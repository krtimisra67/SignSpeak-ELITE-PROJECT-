# SignSpeak-ELITE-PROJECT-
A real-time object detection and OCR pipeline using YOLO and Gemini API that not only detects and reads text from specific regions of images—but also speaks it out loud. Combines the power of YOLOv11 for detection, Gemini for intelligent text recognition, and text-to-speech to create a seamless "See → Read → Speak" experience.
